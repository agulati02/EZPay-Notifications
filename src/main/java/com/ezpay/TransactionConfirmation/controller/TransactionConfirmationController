Transaction Confirmation Controller 
The TransactionConfirmationController module handles user interactions related to transaction 
confirmations. It provides a command-line interface for users to check the status of their transactions, 
whether notifications have been enabled or received, and to retrieve details about completed transactions.
 The module interacts with the `TransactionConfirmationService` to perform these operations based on user 
 input.
